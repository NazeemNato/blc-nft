# Bored laptop Club - BLC

Ah sunday, I'm bored. So i made this NFT to play with. Thanks to OpenZeppelin for the smart contract and hardhat for the test environment.


## Getting started

1. compile the smart contract with `yarn compile`
2. test the smart contract with `yarn test`
3. deploy the smart contract to rinkeby  with `yarn deploy:rinkeby`

this will deploy the smart contract to the rinkeby network. You can also deploy to mainnet with `yarn deploy:mainnet` (just change code in `hardhat.config.js`)
